## Practice Questions
1. How do you assess the statistical significance of an insight?
    Statisitical siginificance of an insight is crucila to figuring out if observed result has real effect orr is due to chance.
    To do thhat you need to go through hypothesis tsesting and p-values (which is the probability of our observations occurring by chance, given the null hypothesis, is the pvalue ().
    Below I will wrtite steps to be taken to validate your insights:
    1) First you need to formulate the Hypothesis
    2) Next you choose a Significance Level 
    3) Then you collect and Analyze Data
    4) Perform appropriate statistical analysis (e.g., t-tests, chi-square tests, ANOVA, regression analysis) depending on your data and research question.
    5) Calculate the Test Statistic
    6) Compute the P-Value - The p-value is a measure of how extreme your observed data is, assuming the null hypothesis is true. A smaller p-value suggests stronger evidence against the null hypothesis.
    If your p-value is less than or equal to the chosen significance level (alpha), you reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis.
    7) Interpret the Results
    8) Report Your Findings - In your report or research paper, describe the results, including the p-value and your conclusion about the statistical significance of the insight.

2. What is the Central Limit Theorem? Explain it. Why is it important?
    It is is a powerful statistical concept that underpins the use of parametric statistical methods in real-world applications. 
    It simplifies the analysis of data by allowing us to rely on the properties of the normal distribution, even when dealing with populations that are not normally distributed, 
    provided the sample size is sufficiently large.




3. What is the statistical power?


4. How do you control for biases?

    Controlling for biases is one of the challenges of good
